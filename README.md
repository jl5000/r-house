The site is generated using:

* The `blogdown` package by Yihui Xie
* The Hugo static-site generator (used by `blogdown`)
* The [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) theme by Michael Romero
* The site is automatically built and hosted with Netlify (hence the absence of a /public folder).
